# Moyeu

Moyeu is an Android application built with [Xamarin.Android](http://xamarin.com/monoforandroid) to visualize Boston's [Hubway](http://thehubway.com/) bike sharing system.

## Building

To build Moyeu you need to follow the instruction on how to setup [Google Play Services](https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/tree/master/GooglePlayServices) (used for the Google Maps v2 API).

Since you are going to use Google API, you also need to [setup an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#the_google_maps_api_key) with them.
